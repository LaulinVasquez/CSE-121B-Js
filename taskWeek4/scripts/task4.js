// Step 7: Inside of the empty array above, add a new object with two properties: place and length and values of an empty string

// Step 8: For each property, add appropriate values as strings

// Step 9: Add additional objects with the same properties for each place you've lived


/* OUTPUT */

// Step 1: Assign the value of the name property (of the object declared above) to the HTML <span> element with an ID of name
document.getElementById("name").innerHTML = personalInfo.name;
// Step 2: Assign the value of the photo property as the src attribute of the HTML <img> element with an ID of photo
document.querySelector("#photo").setAttribute("src", personalInfo.photo);

// Step 3: Assign the value of the name property as the alt attribute of the HTML <img> element with an ID of photo
document.getElementById("photo").innerHTML = "clasic";

// Step 4: For each favorite food in the favoriteFoods property, create an HTML <li> element and place its value in the <li> element
const foods = personalInfo.favoriteFoods.map((food)=> `<li>${food}</li>`);
// Step 5: Append the <li> elements created above as children of the HTML <ul> element with an ID of favorite-foods
document.getElementById("favorite-foods").innerHTML = `<ul>${foods.join(" ")}</ul>`;

// Step 6: Repeat Step 4 for each hobby in the hobbies property
const hobbies = personalInfo.hobbies.map((hobby)=> `<li>${hobby}</li>`);
// Step 7: Repeat Step 5 using the HTML <ul> element with an ID of hobbies
document.getElementById("hobbies").innerHTML = `<ul>${hobbies.join(" ")}</ul>`;

// Step 8: For each object in the <em>placesLived</em> property:
// - Create an HTML <dt> element and put its place property in the <dt> element
// - Create an HTML <dd> element and put its length property in the <dd> element
const places = personalInfo.placesLived.map((placeLived) => `
<dt>-${placeLived.place}</dt>
<dd>length: ${placeLived.length}</dd>`);
// Step 9: Append the HTML <dt> and <dd> elements created above to the HTML <dl> element with an ID of places-lived
document.getElementById("places-lived").innerHTML = `<dl>${places.join(" ")}</dl>`
